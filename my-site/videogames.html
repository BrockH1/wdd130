        <p>Many years have passed since the titular God of War, Kratos took his vengeance against the Olympian gods. Having survived his final encounter with his father Zeus, Kratos has since travelled to Midgard in Ancient Norway and now lives with his young son Atreus in the world of the Norse gods, a savage land inhabited by many ferocious monsters and warriors. In order to teach his son, whose mother (and Kratos's second wife) has recently died, how to survive in such a world, Kratos must master the rage that has driven him for many years and embrace his newfound role as a father and a mentor.</p>

        <p>It's the end of the world. The year is 2033. Humanity is dead, and there are only desperate survivors fighting to stay alive just a minute longer. Infected by the Cordyceps fungi, there now exist infected humans who can only 'see' through sound and crave human flesh. Traveling across the desolate United States, Joel must escort a young girl named Ellie to the resistance group 'The Fireflies'. Ellie is the key to the human race's survival.</p>
