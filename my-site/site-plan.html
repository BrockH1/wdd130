      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever tried to have a conversation with someone who knows much more about a book/game/film franchise than you? 
        I want to create a medium for people to 
        catch up quick on their favorite franchise in order to watch the new installment, 
        or keep up to speed with a significant other who has already seen all the products. 
        Consider it a "Insert film/book/game series" for dummies. 
        The site helps people to hold up a conversation about the franchise, become more invested in the installments, 
        and not burn out at the beginning because it's all too confusing.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site is meant for anyone who's old enough to comprehend a multi-layered story. The content of the site should stay family
        friendly so the site is suitable for minors.

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page will include a welcome banner and an explanation as to what the website is about. 
        The design will be simple and clean with images that feature some of the most popular franchises to catch the user`s attention. 
        A prominent search bar will be included to encourage the user to see if their favorite franchise is found in the website. 
        There could also be links directly to certain installments, possibly the most current ones, 
        to help the user dive into the content of the website. 
        There could also be a list called “What`s hot” with links to franchises and installments that are being talked about the most.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img class = "comics" src="images/comics.jpg" alt="comics">
        <img class = "movie" src="images/movie.jpg" alt="movie">

      </ul>
      <h3>Franchises</h3>
      <p>
        Story Hub is the place for anybody to catch up on the story of a popular franchise. 
        On many occasions, a parent or grandparent tries to be involved in their child/grandchild`s interests, 
        but can`t understand why the superheroes are collecting the infinity stones. 
        A young adult wants to impress their significant other by having an understanding of the videogame they`re playing. 
        Story Hub gives these people a place to find simple summaries of these franchises, take quizzes to learn faster, 
        and see what other people think about the franchise. Story Hub will cover media such as movies, streaming series, 
        television shows, and video games. Franchises such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, Stranger Things, Marvel, 
        and God of War will be included. To start out, the content will be limited, but the site will be consistently updated, 
        especially as the website receives more traffic. Each franchise will have a summary and a list of its installments, 
        listed by its release date. The franchise will then be broken down into individual installments, 
        and each installment will have an explanation of overarching plots that connect several installments and key moments in the plots. 
        This will all be broken down into easily-digestible sections. 
        There will also be information on major characters and their relationships with other characters. 
        An explanation of important themes will also be included. It will even point out plot holes to dispel confusion. 
        Each installment will have a small quiz with trivia questions to help the user test their knowledge. 
        The questions will be listed above and the answers will simply be listed at the bottom of the page. 
      </p>

        <img class = "spiderman" src="images/spiderman.jpg" alt="spiderman">

      </ul>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>
        The features page will include additional resources such as links to fan-pages and merchandise. 
        There will also be articles that cover various topics, including fan-theories, character analysis, 
        and in-depth looks at specific plot points. These articles will be written by hired writers who are good at writing stuff.
        Another feature will be a news and reviews section that will have trailers for upcoming installments, 
        behind the scenes information, and interviews with the actors and creators. These will probably be links to youtube videos.
        People will also be able to leave comments and reviews of the installments and start conversations. Conversations like how to
        fill a site plan with 600 words even though saying what each page will have seems pretty straight forward unless the person writing
        the plan doesn't have the right idea as to what he's supposed to write. He'll probably just put in some random words as filler and 
        give the TA a good chuckle before he docks 20 points.
