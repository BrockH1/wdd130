        <p class = product-desc>In the aftermath of Captain America: Civil War, Peter Parker, a 15-year-old sophomore and Tony Stark's protégé, finds himself back in Queens, New York trying to juggle high school and his superhero alter-ego. As Peter is on pins and needles waiting for his mentor to give him a chance to prove his mettle and become an official Avenger, Stark chooses to keep Peter on a short leash instead, fearful that the boy might bite off more than he can chew. And then, the Vulture, a winged super-criminal brandishing advanced Chitauri weaponry, emerges. Of course, Parker sees his arrival as a golden opportunity to demonstrate that he has what it takes to be part of the Earth's mightiest team of superheroes. But is Spider-Man ready to be more than the neighborhood's friendly, web-slinging defender?</p>

        <h class = product-title>Spiderman: Far from Home</h>
        <p class = product-desc>Shortly after the cataclysmic events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), Peter Parker is yearning for normalcy in a post-Blip world. To blow off steam, Parker and his classmates from the Mid-town School of Science and Technology go on a two-week summer field trip to Europe, and this time, he is determined to ask his crush, MJ, out. However, Nick Fury, the no-nonsense founder of the Avengers, has other plans in store for the sixteen-year-old super-hero, as the Elementals, all-powerful, inter-dimensional creatures formed from the primary elements, start to materialise on Earth, wreaking havoc across the world. Surprisingly, only one man has stood up against this new form of threat and managed to tell the tale: Mysterio, a brave new hero. As humankind's latest adversary threatens to wipe Venice off the face of the Earth, Spider-Man joins forces with Mysterio to lend a hand in the battle, only to make a calamitous mistake. In the end, was Tony Stark wrong about Peter?  </p>

        <h class = product-title>Spiderman: No Way Home</h>
        <p class = product-desc>With his identity compromised, right after the spectacular confrontation with super-hero charlatan Mysterio in Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019), Peter Parker is now with his back to the wall. On the run and having no one to turn to for advice, desperate Peter seeks a radical and equally dangerous solution to right a wrong, utterly unaware of the grave consequences of his ill-advised decision. And, as the unfathomable Multiverse expands with a vengeance, formidable adversaries from a not-so-distant past, too, seek closure, demanding the Spider's head on a platter. But when there's no way home and nowhere to hide, whom can Parker trust?  </p>
